# Auto-Search
Project for scraping and analyzing data on cars for sale online, in local markets only.  Not much support is avaiable for analyzing cars that aren't in major channels, like autotrader or cars.com, so I wanted to try this on local markets.  There are typically better deals there, with more private sellers selling in local classifieds because it's free.

# Current Status
Currently, I've made a bot that scrapes the KSL Auto website (local market = Salt Lake City/Utah) and saves the data out to JSON when running run.sh.

# Wish list
I'd love to expand this to Craigslist and other local classifieds. Preferably not Craigslist untli they have more constraints and less spam, though.
